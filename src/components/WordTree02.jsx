The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",

    "You. The module on the inner critic, it's cracked everything open. By you taking responsibility for someone else's behaviors, you're setting your inner world, uh, up in a way which is abusive. Do you think there's anger? If I'm being really blunt of what I think is happening is I think there's anger, but I think you're turning it against yourself. Yeah. This is in therapy with alex howard, a, uh, first of its kind series that places you directly in the therapy realm. My name is alex howard, and it is my hope that by bringing you on the journey with us, you, too, can learn the tools to transform your life. This series we're following haley, whose traumatic upbringing has resulted in severe depression and anxiety, as well as debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. Haley has come to in therapy because she's decided enough is enough and wants to live the rest of her life free from the constraints of the past. She'll be dead, and I'll be standing at the edge of a grave going, I really tried, and she'll think I didn't try. You have been traumatized by a dynamic, and then you have been, in a sense, pulled into an ongoing way of relating, which is fundamentally unhealthy. I've cried too many tears. I'm not going back. I've been through too much. Join us each week as we follow every step of haley's journey, both in and outside of the therapy room. As well as the tools I give haley in the sessions, I'll also be sharing weekly top tips so you can begin to unlock your true potential. This is in therapy. Good afternoon, haley. How are you doing? Yeah, not too bad. How are you doing? You feel really nervous? Because I don't usually bother, but for the first time ever, I'm like. I mean, if you want to go home, haley, you can go home. I've only just got here that we drove this morning. Did you? Did you? Well, come take a seat. How are things generally, though? Um, you had a lot on last time we saw you. Lots of different things. Thanks for the water. It's jeremiah. This time, you have to thank. Yeah, yeah. It's been a week from hell, really, but it's good that it's come because it's cracked open pandora's box, and it's like, okay, now you get into the real issues. Wow. Which is probably why I feel nervous, but, yeah, it's completely cracked everything open. Wow. Yeah. So I think that's probably why my nerves and my anxiety is all over the place. Okay. But I suppose that speaks testimony to the programme that Alex has put forward for you to follow, because I'm thinking I'm doing okay here. I know half of this quite arrogantly marching through, as you do, and then all of a sudden you hit something. It's like, okay, this is cracked half a pain out now. So it's been a tough week. Um, but it's good, really. The progress we make in therapy is sometimes subtle and not always immediately apparent. However, sometimes we can experience a significant shift in the way we think, feel and understand ourselves. Something has clearly changed for Hayley and I'm keen to find out what it is. Here's the session. Okay. Well, Haley, it's absolutely very surprising. I was very tired, very fragile. It's very nice to see you. Um, when I saw you last week, you were fresh out of, um, your triumph with the commonwealth, um, um, torch. But also it'd been a really, uh, intense kind of week or so. So firstly, just wondering how you've been doing since then and you managed to get some rest. Yeah. I was just saying to all of you before, it's my fifth time and for the first time, feel really nervous, uh, which is crazy because I didn't even feel nervous the first time. But I've walked in today and I'm like, um, really sort of edgy as you've just seen. You just said booty me. I was like, genuinely shocked. Even though you're sitting opposite of me, I'm like, what's that? So I'm really like, do you know why? Yeah, I was just going to say, working through the material, sort of with the module on the inner critic, it's cracked everything open. Wow. And it's like, okay, so now we've hit the real stuff. The main point of it is it's really hard, um, to deal with the inner critic when I feel in my life that so many outer critics. Yes. So every time I get an outer critic comment, my inner critic psychoanalyzes it and sees if I need to change and adapt. So it's a, um, maladaptive response for sure, but it's kept me for 50 od years. So it feels like I've got so many outer critics that the inner critic is checking and, uh, keeping me to be the best I can be in a difficult situation. So it's really hard to let go of it. I think what's probably also happening is your inner critic is perpetuating that dynamic. In a sense. It's like you've been used to being spoken to in a certain way. And then you've learned to speak to yourself in that way, and then that's become the normal. And then what we're doing is we're putting a spotlight on that and realizing that perhaps not only does that not have to be normal, but it also is probably quite damaging, in a sense. In the week leading up to this session, my producers, Oliver, uh, and Jeremiah, visited Hayley to find out more about how the outer critics in her life affect how she relates to herself, particularly when it comes to her sense of inner worth and inner goodness. So much of how I see myself is wrapped up in how other people see me. And I've not always been surrounded by people that have been very positive. So what they deem as good matters more to me than what I think is good. But in my opinion, their idea of what's good isn't my idea of what's good. So, um, people want to call conditions of worth. I think people want to make you into what they want you to be. And I am so not that person. I'm so different. And so m. I've got to say it in my parents eyes. Um, I'm not what they want me to be, so they see no goodness in me. So, um, it's really hard because they want me to be a certain way and I'm not and feel like I'm letting them down. And I've got shitloads of awards at home. I've got mind media mental health award. I've got British Heart foundation award. I've got Queen's Platinum Jubilee award. I've got the Baton Caron award. I've got awards for writing. I've got piles of awards at home and fucking worthless because I'm not this person that these people want me to be. So I could stand there and get any award. And it's worthless because I'm not this person that they want me to be. And it's like, I'm really sorry, but I can't go back in my box because I have to be true to me. And I'm sorry that I can't be who you want me to be. And I'm sorry to let you down. I'll get attacked. I've got hammered. And hammered, and hammered. I got hammered this morning. Hammered, hammered, hammered. And I'm, um, told I'm a horrible person. And I said, oh, come on. I won an award yesterday. I carried a button to the top of my mind, and it just don't mean anything because I can't m be what they want me to be and do what they want me to do, but it's not true to me. And I have to be what they want me to be or who I am. And I think all the time I'm trying to prove to them that I can do stuff. I'm trying to meet these conditions of worth. And if I'd get this, you might. I don't know if any of that makes any sense, but I feel like whenever I get something in me that says, you did okay, there's a bit of me. I can always hear a voice saying that shit. And that inner critic feels so justified because it keeps me down. But there's a bit of. Bit of me that pops through, and I'll stand there and my mom will say, you've really changed. You have. I don't like the person you are. And I'll say back to it, thank, uh, God I've changed. And when she says, no, God, I'll say, but these people think I'm okay. Look at this award. I've got this, got this. I've got this. And she doesn't say anything. I'm not blaming my mom and dad because my mom, because she's been through stuff, and she is who she is, but I have to be me. Um, so it is uncomfortable saying that I've done stuff. Back to the session. When you say, it's not her fault, whose fault is it? I'll have to think about that for what my mom's been through. So I think we have to separate the experience that she's had and the behaviors that she exhibits, because lots of people have been through awful, difficult experiences, but not everyone comes out behaving the same ways. So I kind of wonder where that place of personal responsibility lies in that for her. Yeah. Um, isn't it brain differences? I just can't put any blame at her door. He sits at mine. But, you see, I think that's the crux of this issue, isn't, uh, it? That it's always your fault and never her fault. And I'm not here to make your mum wrong and to play a blame game on your mum either. But the point that I'm wanting to make is that by you taking responsibility for someone else's behaviors, you're setting your inner world up, um, in a way which is abusive. Yeah. I don't know. She's probably right, though. It probably is my fault for some of the things. For example, um, m my brother and his girlfriend, I want to put a bit of distance between me and them. Because if I don't, I will have a conversation with them that I fear may hurt them, because I'll tell them what I think, because I will not be incongruent in a relationship. If you want me in your life, I have to be real or I'm not there. I want to haul them up on some of the behavior towards my mom, um, because I don't want to hurt them. I want to avoid them till standing myself and get myself well. So I need that boundary, um, and my mom will not have it. And she's threatening suicide. She's playing us, calling us in the middle of the night and, uh, send us away when there's nothing wrong. And then she's saying, you're not coming to the hospital with me. You hate me. You're a jealous little bitch. And she's ripping seven bowels out of me. Then she went onto the phone. Then she's calling me again, saying, come back over mail. And we're up and down like a yoyo, just being played. And it's interesting that you say that you won't be incongruous with someone in your life, but what I'm hearing you say is, with your mom, there is some appropriate anger and frustration on your part. Like, there's a place where you can see that her behavior is actually toxic and it's not appropriate. I don't think there's anger. There's deep sorrow. Do you think there's anger? I don't think it's possible for there not to be anger. The anger may not be owned. And if I'm being really blunt of what I think is happening is I think there's anger, but I think you're turning it against yourself. Yeah. So your inner critic has taken the anger that actually is suitably placed towards your mum and is turning it against you. Yeah, I'm angry with me. I want to make her world right. And I'm really sorry that I can't all want to do is make everything right for it, and I can't because my brother tweets her horrendously, like, she fell out of bed and broke her neck. And he said she might die and he wouldn't even go and see her. And yet he eats food there every night downstairs and gets weighted on by it. And it's like, how can you not go up and see your mom, who may die because she broke a neck? How can you not go up and say, because, uh, I can't sit with that. But we can't change the relationship between your brother and your mum. Yeah. What we can do is look at, uh, your boundaries and your relationship between you and your brother and you and your mum. Yeah. Because what I'm hearing is that, uh, your mom is. I mean, you said it yourself is playing you and is treating you in ways which, ah, uh, are cruel. Really bad. You couldn't make it up. I couldn't even tell you honestly, it's really bad. And so something I said to you a few sessions ago is. It's almost like there's a continuum of responsibility. Some people blame everyone else for everything and other people blame themselves for everything. The appropriate place to sit on that continuum is probably somewhere in the middle. And sometimes it might move a little bit in different directions. But right now you're making yourself responsible for your mum's actions and your mum's behaviors. And the problem is you can't change your mum's actions and behaviors. So you are not ultimately responsible, because responsible means you are responsible. You are able to respond and change the response of what's happening, but you're not able to change it. So by definition of not being able to change it, you can't be held responsible for it. I try and put everything. I try and be the perfect person, like she said. You've just said on the phone to me that you only care about your dad. And I was thinking to myself, she sat by a bunch of flowers that I just bought her. She said, I don't care about her. But last night I drove for 3 hours from where we were in the caravan to be with her because she got headache to then drive 3 hours back. So I gave up a night's sleep for in the middle of the night. My brother lives seven doors down, and she never called him, which called me 3 hours away. Uh, my presence there says, I care, but you throw in my face, I don't care. I care. That's why I was with you all. So how does that make you feel? Just devastated. It's like, how can I try any more? What else can I do to make a will? Right? Because what I feel is your frustration. Just. Just, uh, m. I just hate hurting it. And it's like, she'll be dad, she's 83, she'll be dad. And I'll be standing at the edge of a grave going, I really tried. And she'll think. I didn't try. You can't make her, uh, think what you might want her to think. And you can't ultimately be responsible for her happiness and her well being. She keeps making me. She keeps telling me, um, it's my fault. That's what she's telling you. And that's what, historically, you've bought as the narrative and the story. And what you and I are doing here together is we are challenging. Is that actually true? It's like this is a, uh, shared belief, in a sense, that you have shared with her for decades. And it hasn't really been questioned. It's just been she's made you responsible and you've taken responsibility, and like a, uh, kind of typical functional, dysfunctional dynamic, it's just continued. But what we're doing here together is we're challenging it and we're saying, actually, it might have worked because you both believed the same belief. But there's an enormous price that you are paying in your emotional body and in your physical body for this shared narrative that may, uh, not be true. There is a part of me that knows that. I know there is. Yeah. Because if there wasn't, you wouldn't be here. Ah, yeah. There's a part of me that you. Didn'T come here for me to confirm everything that you've told yourself in the past. You came here because there's a place in you that knows that not only could things be different, things could be different, but things need to be different. Yeah. It's just so od because it's thrown at me so often. And honestly, there's some stuff that I really can't say on camera. But there's another side to it that. You see how I've been ripped apart, and that's fine. It's a trauma response. Ultimately, you have been traumatized by a dynamic, and then you have been, in a sense, pulled into an ongoing way of relating, which is fundamentally unhealthy. Yeah. And the reality is, right now, you are in an unhealthy dance together, and you are realizing that you need to change the dance. That's going to leave your mom and your brother and your dad and others one of three choices. They're either going to come and dance with you in the new dance, or what's probably more likely to happen, at least in the short term, they're going to try and pull you back to the old dance because that's what's familiar to them, or you're going to have to dance separate dances. But what I think is clear for you is you can't just stay in the old dance anymore. M your physical body is giving you the evidence that you can't do that. Yeah, uh, she did say, uh, you've really changed. You used to be okay, but now you're just a jealous little bitch. I've really changed. The trouble is, ah, I'll stand up to it. And then I hate myself for it. And this is where the inner critic comes in. And it won't be nasty, but I'll hold my own and say I had to change woman. And I feel. Then I go and cry for hours because I answered her back. Um, that's the hard bit. I know I have to change, but it makes me cry because I've held my own and stuck up for myself. And I want to say to her, I'll do anything for you. Anything. But there's a part of me where she wants me to reconcile with my brother and his girlfriend. And there's a part of me that can't at this moment because I've got to protect myself. And also I've got to protect them because I'll have them because I can't stand what they did. And I'll have to say, guide. You wear out a line here. And I don't want that conversation because I don't want to hear, do you. Feel angry towards your brother? No, because he went through what I did. And I feel it's pain. He's reacted the other way. It's interesting. So what I notice is that, and this is not an uncommon thing, that two things can be true for you at once. So, on one hand, there's the emotional place in you that feels the way you describe your brother. I feel a certain amount of anger and frustration and sort of irritation around it. But then what I notice you do is you explain away your feelings with rationality and logic. So, for example, with your mom, you can see that the behavior is unreasonable. And you can see that it needs to stop. And for you to see that, there must be a certain amount of emotion, which is like, this is not okay, I need this to stop. But then what I notice you do is your mind then rationalizes away your feelings. Like, tells you that your feelings are not important. And they're like this because of what happened to them and it's not their fault. And effectively, you're explaining away your true emotional response to things. The thing that doesn't sit with me, I, uh, realize that there's an area that others can see things in you that you can't see in yourself. The thing that never sits with me is, I don't call it anger. I call it deep sorrow. Anger doesn't sit with me, I get angry at animal abuse. That makes me angry. That makes me really angry. But I don't feel anger. Um, towards, when you were a girl, were you allowed to be angry? Um, I wasn't allowed to be anything. Trust me, I wasn't even. But you particularly wouldn't have allowed to be angry. M I saw so much anger with my mom. Ah. I looked and thought, I will never be that, because that is just the most awful. So tell me what you learned about anger. Um, but I learned it about every emotion. You don't cry. If you break your neck, you just shut up. Shut up. But you see, I think sadness and deep sorrow seem to be more allowed in your inner world, but anger doesn't seem to be allowed. And let me say a few words about my thesis on anger and why I think it's so important. Anger is effectively one expression of our life force energy. Our life force energy being, uh, our passion, our fire, our strength. Uh, I want this, and I'm going to go and make it happen. It's the positive expression, our personal power, our ability to go. This is what I care about, and I'm going to fight to bring it to life. The destructive expression of that same quality is anger, uh, hatred, aggression. But the energy behind it is a really important, powerful one. There's a very big difference between having the feeling of anger and throwing anger at other people, okay? Between having the feeling of anger and acting out the feeling at other people. So you might be feeling really angry, and my invitation would be to really go into that feeling. But that's not the same as having a massive shouting match at someone which has its place, but is often not so helpful, because the feeling of anger is the power behind our, uh, boundaries, which say, no, okay? Like, that behavior is unacceptable. But to be able to have an empowered, no, we've got to have the fuel of the emotion behind it. Otherwise, it's just an empty word. Is it not more emotionally mature to look at with an empathic view of what she's been through to then? Uh, is that not. What people tend to do is they try to bypass their emotions to get to that place. Now, that may be the emotional destination, having metabolized and processed the emotions, but when you try to get there by thinking your way there, what you're doing is you're disowning all of these feelings and emotions that you have. I can't find the anger, though. I can find deep sorrow, but I can't find any anger. It's not her fault. She didn't get the privilege of sitting here like I, um, am. She didn't get, uh, that privilege. How is it her fault? Nobody reached it and helped her back then as she grow up? Therapy was not the thing. There's a difference between having empathy for someone and, uh, having a boundary to say their behavior is not acceptable. Because on the logic that you're running, anything can be justified. We could justify Putin invading Ukraine, had trauma, went through difficult experiences. So there has to be a point where one says, I can understand in my mind, I might even understand in my heart, and that behavior is. I just. It's really difficult because I sit here now and everything you say makes sense. And then when you're not here, uh, everything falls. Not everything, though. Mhm. Because things are changing. And that's the challenge, isn't it? That's part of why it's difficult, because things are changing. Yeah. The hardest thing for me. You can ask me to run six marathons after a heart attack. Yeah, I can do that. I can do anything. I can do manage. You ask me to do this and it's like, no, I will not. And yet you're here, and we're having a very honest conversation about it, and you are starting to put some boundaries in place, and you're starting to see the situation with a clarity. You've not seen it before. Yeah, there is a gentle ferocity. I know that's an oxymoron. Um, but there is within me that kind of. That I can hold my own. I feel it. A gentle fierceness. Like, I know that doesn't make sense, but there is a part of me that will. I've just been through too much, uh, to not hold my own. And I'll do with the most gentleness, but I will hold my own because you cannot put me back in that box, and I won't go back in the box. I've just been through too much shit. What do you feel as you say, that? Because I feel your strength. As you say, that is strength. It's like, nah, tell you what, I've cried too many tears. I'm not going back. I've been through too much. Learning to feel your emotions is not just important from the point of view of not carrying those old emotions in our physical and our emotional body. It's also important because our emotions have gifts to bring us in our life. People often think about anger as something to get rid of, to get away from. Now, as I talked with Haley about, it's not about throwing anger at other people, but the life force of our anger is our strength. It's our capacity to go for things we want in our lives, but also to set boundaries, to say no and to feel our strength, our capacity behind that no behind that boundary. And I find working with people that often there is a sequence to being able to really get contact with and learn to heal our emotions in a healthy way. Firstly, we often have to learn to calm and to settle our nervous system because then we are closer to our feelings. But if we don't then work with our emotions, we'll find ourselves then speeding up again, trying to get away from those feelings. And so as we calm our system and feel our emotions, we're then more able to reset the relationships in our lives. If you'd like to learn more about the importance of resetting your nervous system, I have a free three part video series that you can find at ah, reset alexhouer.com. And as part of that free series, you'll also find out more about my online coaching program, the reset program. Did you start to play with the new ways of defending against your inner critic? I couldn't because at the moment I read it and thought about it, but at the moment it feels like I can't do any of them because it sits with me. I feel that they should be criticizing me and I should be criticizing me. So I'm not at that stage yet. I'm still working through, um, where I'm taking it and absorbing the criticism. I don't know. I'm going to stop the criticism feeling that I deserve it. So there's effectively, there's a belief that you deserve the criticism. And until we shift that belief, what you're saying is a problem is that it's still going to happen because you believe you deserve it. Yeah, at the m moment. Yeah. I like you saying at the moment because what that presupposes is that you believe it can be different. Yeah. When do you remember first learning this belief that you deserve criticism? Yeah. Um, I was at Butleans and psychological sat on the floor. That's funny. It came straight away into it. I didn't even think. I just went bang, tiny. I was three or something. Sat on the floor. Um, hang on. Yeah. I was either sat on the floor or stood up. And the commentator said, sit down if you think you're pretty. And everybody sat down. I was the only one stood up with a full awareness. That was ugly. It was something along those lines. I was the one person that didn't sit down when everybody else did. And it was about a confluence about yourself. And I thought, I remember being tiny, thinking, I've got to stand up. I know Mugley. I know Mugley. Something like that. How old would you have been to think? Three. Yeah. But the fact that you had that belief then means you must have already been told that. Uh, I don't know. I don't have a memory being told that. But I was always called a stupid. Child by who. Straight away I jumped to the empathy. And people like they are through what they've been through. Yeah. So again, back to what I said a little bit earlier, because I think it's an important point to reiterate that I think part of what happens is you undermine your emotional response with a rational response. And that rational response, I think, is your inner critic. I think it's your inner critic presenting in a sly way, because it's what it's really doing is what it's really saying underneath all the words is your feelings don't matter. Okay. The rest is just noise. Yeah. It's like, oh, they can't help it. Whatever it's saying. What it's really saying is your feelings don't matter. Okay. And your feelings do matter. Okay? Yeah. Okay. How does that feel? I have to walk and carry this. And it feels like I can carry it when you're sat there. But in a few weeks time when you're not in real life, it's like, am I going to be able to grab it, walk with it? And it's this codependency on people that help me. So I'm just going to move in with you, Alex? Um, uh, I've got to own it and walk with it for when you're not there. And that's the bit that makes me sad, that it's like I can do it while you're here, but I can't do when you're not there. But you see, it's interesting because I think you thought you couldn't do, uh, it while I was here. So the fact you can do it while I'm here shows you can do it. And then it's figuring out how do we need to set things up so you can continue to do it for yourself. Okay, so I'm not moving in with you then, is that. No, it's a very clear no, I'm afraid. Haley? Yes, Oliver. You like me? He said yes. You got a solution? I came with two emotions. One was all this, and the other, ah, is this, um, sense of loss that you guys have helped me loads and is a massive sense of loss and anticipatory loss. Um. Thank you for helping me, but it is that I'm going to lose this. Well, if we. And I say we, I mean all of us. You, I, Oliver, Jeremiah. If we're doing our jobs correctly, yes, there's a gradual removing of some of the structure and support, but the things that you're learning, once you've seen you can't unsee them. You must sometimes forget them and need to find ways to remind yourself of them. But they're fundamentally new ways of seeing and understanding your life, and you can't unsee them when you've seen them. Okay. So our goal is to help you remember. Yeah. Okay. And when it comes to creating change in our life, often the hardest thing is to get the ball rolling. It's like taking a car from stationary to 10 miles an hour takes more power than from 10 miles an hour to 20 miles an hour. So what we're doing is getting things moving. Keeping things moving is easier. Okay. Yeah. It feels like I'm on the right track. Ah, it's okay. I feel okay. I also think it's important to be okay with not knowing, because things have been set up the same way for a long time. And going back to my dance of change metaphor, you realize you want to go into a new dance, but you don't really know the new dance very well. Be a bit like me trying to dance. Not very good at it. Takes some time to practice, and then with practice, the new dance starts to become the dance, which then, in time, maybe becomes the old dance and it becomes really familiar. But you got to practice to build that familiarity with it. Yeah. Uh, I just failed. But I have to say that I do love my parents. Yeah, it's okay to love your parents, but loving your parents doesn't mean that you can't have boundaries with them. Yeah. Loving your parents doesn't mean that you can't say no to them. Don't know. Okay. To say yes to yourself, you have to be able to say no to other people. Okay. That's really the crux of what we're saying here. Yeah. Okay. You can't have your cake and eat it in this situation. You can't capitulate to all the needs of your parents and meet your own needs. Okay. I'm not going to give you a lot of homework this week because I think you need to sit with it. I think we're saying a lot here. What I think would be helpful to do would be to keep a little bit of a diary each day of, uh, some of the instances you notice where you could have put in place a better boundary. Okay, so, example might be it's Wednesday evening, and you had a phone call from your mom, and she said that whatever, and you just agreed with her and apologized. And another example might be that you were, uh, remembering a situation, a conversation you had with your brother a while ago, and your inner critic was beating you up, and you just thought, yeah, it's right. So I want to really put the spotlight on and bring the awareness to those patterns. Yeah. So, when something happens, uh, will you just send me one line? Yeah. Okay. Any questions? I come live with you. No. He says. What you really want is the wisdom that we're talking about living inside of you. There's nothing that I'm saying to you that can't live inside of you. But what's important is that it becomes your truth. But what I'm hopefully helping you do is by showing you some different truths, helping you find your truth. Okay, good. Haley. I'll see you next week. One of the impacts of trauma is that we can learn that it is not okay or not safe to feel our emotions, and yet it is sometimes those very emotions that are the key to our healing. Healthy contact with our anger is what allows us to say no and set boundaries, and ultimately, what gives us the capacity to teach people how to treat us in a respectful and appropriate way. Continue to follow Haley's journey over the coming weeks as we release weekly episodes of her sessions with me. You can watch here on YouTube or listen to the episode as a podcast to help support you in coming on the journey with us, I've created some materials to accompany the series. Each week, there is a bonus video with me and a worksheet to bring the session to life for you. In, uh, this week's reflections, you can explore your relationship with anger and some practical tips for how to express it in a healthy way. You can find these resources for free at intherapy alexhoward.com. Here's what's coming up next week. So, you grew up to believe that your mom is more important than you, and you became this person because that was the way you survived. But the bit that I'm really interested in is who you are. That isn't them. Well, thank you, Haley, for that. Um, really appreciate your honesty as always. Um, and, um. Yeah, well, we believe in you is all we're going to say. Thank you. Thank you. And hopefully, you won't need that in future. Hopefully you'll be able to believe in yourself. Um, but for the time being, we have faith that you can do. Oh, thank you. Well, I'm so glad that you guys are going to live with us forever and ever and ever. This is going to be m my bed. We're going to have to get a new car. Close. Mhm.",
